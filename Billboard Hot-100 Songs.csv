"I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need I don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree  I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you, yeah.  I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need And I don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree  I don't need to hang my stocking There upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on Christmas Day  I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you You, baby  Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow And I'm just gonna keep on waiting Underneath the mistletoe  I won't make a list and send it To the North Pole for Saint Nick I won't even stay awake to Hear those magic reindeer click  'Cause I just want you here tonight Holding on to me so tight What more can I do? Baby, all I want for Christmas is you You, baby  Oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere And the sound of children's laughter fills the air  And everyone is singing I hear those sleigh bells ringing Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? Won't you please bring my baby to me?  Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas This is all I'm asking for I just wanna see my baby Standing right outside my door  Oh, I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true Baby, all I want for Christmas is you You, baby  All I want for Christmas is you, baby",2017.0,All I Want For Christmas Is You,mariah carey,24.0,13.0,r&b,Vince Vance & The Valiants,relaxed

So I said I'm a snowball running, Running down into the spring that's coming, All this love melting under blue skies, Belting out sunlight, shimmering love.  Well baby I surrender, To the strawberry ice cream, Never ever end of all this love, Well I didn't mean to do it, But there's no escaping your love.  These lines of lightning, Mean we're never alone, Never alone, no, no.  Come on, come on, move a little closer, Come on, come on, I want to hear you whisper, Come on, come on, settle down inside my love.  Come on, come on, jump a little higher, Come on, come on, if you feel a little lighter, Come on, come on, we were once upon a time in love.

"I had a good life Before you came I had my friends and my freedom I had my name Still there was sorrow and emptiness 'Til you made me glad Oh, in this love I found strength I never knew I had  And this love Is like nothing I have ever known Take my hand, love I'm taking you home I'm taking you home  There were days, lonely days When the world wouldn't throw me a crumb But I kept on believing That this day would come  And this love Is like nothing I have ever known Take my hand, love I'm taking you home I'm taking you-home Where we can be with the ones who really care Home, where we can grow together Keep you in my heart forever  And this love Is like nothing I have ever known Take my hand, love I'm taking you home Taking you home  And this love Is like nothing I have ever known Take my hand, love I'm taking you home I'm taking you home",2000.0,Taking You Home,don henley,20.0,87.0,rock,Don Henley,relaxed
I don't know How I survived In this cold and empty world For all this time I only know That I'm alive Because you love me  When I recall What I've been through There's some things That I wish I didn't do Now I do the things I do Because you love me  And now that you're in my life I'm so glad I'm alive 'Cause you showed me the way And I know now how good it can be Because you love me  Oh and now that you're in my life Oh I'm so glad I'm alive 'Cause you showed me the way And I know now how good it can be Because you love me  I believe in things unseen I believe in the message of a dream And I believe in what you are Because you love me  With all my heart And all my soul I'm loving you And I never will let go And every day I'll let it show Because you love me Because you love me Because you love me,2000.0,Because You Love Me,jo dee messina,13.0,93.0,country,Jo Dee Messina,happy
